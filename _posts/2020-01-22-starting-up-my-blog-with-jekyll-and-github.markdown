## 1. Setup Ruby and Jekyll
In order to install Jekyll you'll need to first get your dev environment cooking with Ruby.

I'm on a windows machine, so I grabbed the recommended installer [HERE][ruby-installer], ran it, and chose the default options (pressed enter instead of choosing a particular option) and let it do it's thing.

[ruby-installer]: https://rubyinstaller.org/downloads/

I then opened a new command prompt - make sure you open one with ruby! - and installed the Jekyll gem using the command:

```bash
gem install jekyll bundler
```

Once that had completed, I checked we were all good by checking the version of Jekyll:

```bash
jekyll -v
```
I then fired up Visual Studio Code, and in the terminal, navigated to my projects folder where I was going to get up my blog folder:

```bash
cd documents/projects/blog
```

I then created a new Jekyll site, called "ppblog":

```bash
jekyll new ppblog
```

Then, change into the root directory created for the new site, and do a test serve:

```bash
cd ppblog
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

In my browser, I opened up https://localhost:4000 and voil√°! You'll see a placeholder post, all ready to re-purpose.

From here, you can edit your first post and such, which I'll leave up to you for now. Plenty of documentation can be found on the Jekyll site here.

## 2. Setup GitHub Pages to host your Jekyll site

First, you need to have a repo made, in case you need to. In order for it to work with GitHub pages, you need to name it YOURUSERNAME.github.io

https://github.com/MistaTwist/MistaTwist.github.io

You need to ensure that it's not initialised with a readme.

Next, in the terminal, back in your project's root folder (in this example it's ppblog), do the following:

```bash
git init
```
This initialises your project as a git repo.

If youve made any changes, you can commit them, along with a message, via the source control section in the VSCode side-navigation.

Next, we run the following commands:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/MistaTwist.github.io.git
git push -u origin master
```

The above commands do the following:

- Adds a remote git repo (target to push code to) called "origin" to your project. It's like an alias.
- Pushes your local code to the master branch of the repo and adds an upstream association to our newly added remote "origin".

And there you go - if you now browse to your repo in GitHub, and browse to the Settings tab, scrolling down you'll see the GitHub Pages section, where the link to your site will be.

Now I'm ready to blog, and so are you :)
